# Engineering Data Analysis with MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB programming assignments and projects from an introductory programming course for biomedical engineers. The work focuses on using MATLAB for data analysis, visualization, numerical computation, and modeling applications relevant to engineering and biomedical contexts.

## Course Context
**Introduction to Programming for Biomedical Engineers (BME 211)**  
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to programming using MATLAB. Topics include importing and exporting data, numerical computation, data visualization, and solving engineering problems using MATLAB.

## Topics & Skills
- MATLAB scripting and functions
- Data import, processing, and visualization
- Numerical computation and modeling
- Debugging and structured problem solving
- Engineering-focused data analysis workflows

## Repository Structure
- `/homework` – Weekly programming assignments
- `/quizzes` – Short problem-based assessments
- `/exams` – Midterm and final exam solutions
- `/projects` – Larger applied scripts and modeling problems

## Notes
This repository reflects academic coursework and emphasizes clarity, correctness, and problem-solving over production-level optimization.
